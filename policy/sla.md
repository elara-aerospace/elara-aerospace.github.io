## Contribution Guidelines

**Issue Response Time**
- Maintainers will aim to provide an initial response to new issues within 3 business days.
- This response may be an acknowledgment, request for more information, or initial assessment.

**Pull Request Review**
- Initial review of pull requests will be targeted within 7 business days of submission.
- Complex pull requests may require additional time for thorough review.

**Release Cycle**
- We strive to release new versions of our software on a regular schedule, typically every 4-6 weeks.
- Critical bug fixes may be released more frequently as needed.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

**Code Review**
- Maintainers will provide constructive feedback on pull requests.
- Reviews will focus on code quality, adherence to project standards, and overall impact.

**Documentation**
- Maintainers will ensure that project documentation is kept up-to-date.
- Contributors are encouraged to submit documentation improvements alongside code changes.

**Community Support**
- Maintainers will be available to answer questions and provide guidance through GitHub issues and discussions.

## Contributor Expectations

**Code Quality**
- Contributors are expected to adhere to the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- Submitted code should be well-documented and include appropriate tests.

**Communication**
- Contributors should respond to feedback on their pull requests within a reasonable timeframe.
- If a contributor becomes unavailable, they should communicate this to the maintainers.

**Respect**
- All contributors are expected to follow the project's code of conduct and maintain a respectful and inclusive environment.

## SLA Limitations

It's important to note that this SLA is not a binding contract but a set of mutual expectations. The open source nature of the project means that:

- Timelines may vary based on maintainer availability and project complexity.
- Contributors are not obligated to meet specific deadlines or commit to ongoing work.
- The project may evolve, and priorities may shift based on community needs and resources.

## Continuous Improvement

We are committed to regularly reviewing and improving this SLA policy. Feedback from contributors and users is welcome and will be considered in future revisions.

By participating in our (open source) projects, contributors acknowledge and agree to work within these expectations, understanding that they are guidelines rather than strict obligations.

This SLA policy aims to create a balanced framework that encourages contributions while setting realistic expectations for both maintainers and contributors in an (open source) development environment.
