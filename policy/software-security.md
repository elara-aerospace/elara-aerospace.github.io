## Security Policies and Compliance

Our organization maintains a robust set of information security policies as part of our Information Security Management System (ISMS). These policies provide clear guidance to management and staff on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data. We regularly review and update our security policies to ensure they remain current.

Our goal is to achieve ISO 27001 certification in the future, demonstrating our commitment to information security best practices. Our privacy practices comply with relevant regulations like GDPR.

## Access Control 

We implement strict access control measures, including:

- Complex password requirements (minimum length, uppercase/lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Password hashing in databases
- Two-factor authentication
- Regular access reviews
- Separation of development, testing and production environments

## Software Development

Our secure development lifecycle incorporates security at every stage:

- Peer code reviews
- Security testing (vulnerability scans, penetration tests)
- Separation of development/testing/production environments
- Version control and change management processes

## Infrastructure Security

We employ multiple layers of security controls:

- Enterprise-grade firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems
- Regular vulnerability scans and patching
- Encryption of data in transit (TLS/HTTPS) and at rest
- Redundant systems and backups across multiple data centers
- 24/7 monitoring and incident response

## Incident Management

We have established processes for identifying, containing, assessing and responding to potential security incidents. This includes notifying affected customers and conducting post-incident reviews.

## Third-Party Security 

We carefully vet our technology providers and require them to meet our security standards. Our cloud infrastructure is hosted with leading providers like Amazon Web Services (for Microsoft and GitHub) and Hetzner (for Virtual Machines) that maintain best-in-class security practices.

## Ongoing Commitment

Information security is a top priority for our organization. We are committed to maintaining a strong security posture through continuous improvement of our policies, processes and technical controls. We welcome any questions about our security practices and are happy to provide additional details to users as needed.
