## Safety Protocols and Compliance

Elara Aerospace adheres to strict safety protocols and regulatory compliance for all rocket launch operations. We work closely with launch providers and government agencies like OLM Launch and DIFESA to ensure public safety during rocket launch and reentry operations.

## Range Safety Measures

We implement robust range safety measures for each launch, including:

- Evacuation of areas surrounding the launch pad
- Issuing notices to aviators and mariners to avoid designated locations
- Establishing a secure launch corridor with defined destruct lines
- Continuous monitoring of the rocket's flight path and instantaneous impact point

## Flight Termination System

Our launches utilize a reliable Flight Termination System (FTS) to protect public safety:

- Redundant UHF receivers on the rocket receive coded commands
- Range Safety Officer can issue arm and fire commands if needed
- Linear shaped charges can disable the rocket if it veers off course
- FTS is extensively tested pre-launch and monitored during flight

## Access Control and Security

We maintain strict access control measures at the launch facilities:

- 24/7 monitoring and surveillance 
- Visitor logs and entry requirements
- Secure dedicated rooms for critical hardware
- Background screening for all personnel

## Data Protection

We employ multiple layers of security to protect sensitive launch data:

- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Firewalls and intrusion detection systems
- Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing
- Least-privilege access controls

## Incident Response

We have established processes for identifying, containing, and responding to any potential security incidents or anomalies during launch operations. This includes procedures for notifying relevant authorities and conducting thorough post-incident reviews.

## Continuous Improvement

Launch safety and security are our highest priorities. We are committed to continuously improving our policies, procedures, and technical controls to address evolving threats and challenges in the aerospace industry.
