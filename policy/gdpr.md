## Our Commitment to GDPR Compliance

At Elara Aerospace, we are dedicated to protecting the privacy and security of our customers' personal data. We fully support the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and are committed to ensuring our practices align with its requirements.

## Understanding GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation is a comprehensive privacy law that regulates how businesses collect, use, and store personal data of individuals in the European Union. It aims to give individuals greater control over their personal information and standardize data protection practices across the EU.

## Our GDPR Compliance Measures

To meet our obligations under GDPR, we have implemented the following measures:

### Data Audit and Mapping

We have conducted a thorough audit of our data processing activities to identify:

- What personal data we collect and process
- How data flows through our systems
- Where potential compliance gaps exist

### Updated Policies and Procedures

We have revised our data protection policies and procedures to align with GDPR requirements, including:

- Privacy Policy updates
- Data retention and erasure procedures
- Incident response and breach notification protocols
- International data transfer safeguards

### Enhanced Security Measures

We have strengthened our technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data, including:

- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Access controls and authentication procedures
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Data Subject Rights

We have established processes to facilitate data subject rights requests, including:

- Access to personal data
- Correction of inaccurate information
- Erasure of data (right to be forgotten)
- Data portability
- Objection to processing
- Withdrawal of consent

### Vendor Management

We carefully vet our third-party service providers and have updated our contracts to include GDPR-compliant data processing agreements.

### Staff Training

Our members receive regular training on data protection principles and GDPR compliance to ensure they understand their responsibilities when handling personal data.

## Ongoing Commitment

We recognize that GDPR compliance is an ongoing process. We are committed to:

- Regularly reviewing and updating our data protection practices
