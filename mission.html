				As a pioneer in student rocketry, Elara Aerospace endeavours to construct the first rocket to ascend to an altitude of 100 kilometres. Innovation propels us forward; by pushing the limits with liquid rocket engines, we are able to conduct scientific experiments in the upper atmosphere that are unlike any other. Our objective? Motivate progress in the aerospace industry by providing exceptional prospects for exploration and pioneering revelations. We invite you to collaborate with us as we redefine the boundaries of possibility in the field of aerospace engineering.
