    <h1>Space Pioneers Who Inspired Us</h1>

            <h2>Wernher von Braun</h2>
            <h3>What we like about him:</h3>
            <p>
                Wernher M. M. Freiherr von Braun (1912-1977) was a German-born rocket scientist who played a pivotal role in the development of rocket technology, particularly during World War II. He was instrumental in the creation of the V-2 rocket for
                Nazi Germany.
            </p>

            <p>
                After World War II, von Braun, along with many other German scientists, was brought to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. He continued his work on rocketry and became a key figure in the development of the
                Redstone, Jupiter-C, and Saturn rockets for the U.S. Army and later NASA.
            </p>

            <p>Von Braun’s work on the Saturn V rocket was critical to the success of the Apollo program, enabling the United States to send astronauts to the Moon.</p>

            <h3>Why we love him:</h3>

            <h2>Robert H. Goddard</h2>
            <h3>What we like about him:</h3>
            <p>While Robert Goddard (1882-1945) predates the establishment of NASA, he is often regarded as one of the pioneers of modern rocketry and is a key figure in the history of space exploration.</p>

            <p>Goddard conducted extensive research on rocket propulsion and held numerous patents related to rocket technology. In 1926, he successfully launched the world’s first liquid-fueled rocket.</p>

            <p>
                His work laid the foundation for the development of rocket technology that would eventually lead to space exploration. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is named in his honor, recognizing his
                contributions to the field.

            <h2>C. Katherine Johnson</h2>
            <h3>What we like about her:</h3>
            <p>C. Katherine Johnson (1918-2020) was a brilliant African-American mathematician who made significant contributions to NASA’s early space programs.</p>

            <p>
                She was known for her precise calculations of orbital mechanics, which were essential for the success of the Mercury and Apollo missions. Her work helped ensure the safety of astronauts and the accuracy of their
                trajectories.
            </p>

            <p>
                Johnson’s story gained wider recognition through the book and movie “Hidden Figures,” which highlighted the contributions of African-American women like her to NASA’s space program. Her dedication and talent paved the way
                for future generations of minority scientists and engineers.
