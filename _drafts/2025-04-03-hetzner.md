# Inside the Engine Room: Our Interview with Hetzner  
## Why We Chose Hetzner for Mission-Critical Computing  

In early April, we sat down with **Hetzner** — the provider behind our simulation servers, ERP environment, and password management stack — to talk about how we use their infrastructure to power Elara’s engineering workflows. We also visited one of their data centers: vast halls dedicated to raw computing power, purpose-built for reliability and scale. It’s hard not to be inspired when you’re standing next to the machines that help turn ideas into realworld designs.  

## From Simulation to Iteration — Fast  

In the interview, we walk through how **GPU servers** accelerate our thermal and fluid simulations and how **shared CPU resources** keep every teammate productive — even on Windows-specific tools.  

**The result:** quicker design loops and more time spent validating hardware instead of waiting on compute.  

## Watch the Video

## Let’s Visit Each Other  

We love touring partner facilities — seeing manufacturing lines and data centers up close helps our team design with real-world constraints in mind.
