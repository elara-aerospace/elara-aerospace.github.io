# Elara Aerospace Officially Incorporated as a gGmbH  
## From Idea to Reality  

In early March, we finally reached an important milestone: **Elara Aerospace is now officially incorporated as a gGmbH (gemeinnützige GmbH).** After working on the project digitally and on-and-off for some time, this means we can finally turn ideas into physical parts and real-world projects.  

## A Notary’s Seal of Approval  

The incorporation process also brought a memorable highlight: at the signing, the **Notar** remarked that this is the coolest project he has incorporated in the last few years. A motivating confirmation that we are building something special potential.  

## New Challenges Ahead  

With incorporation come not only opportunities but also challenges. From navigating tax law to setting up the right legal frameworks, we’re laying the foundation for a sustainable and impactful future.  

## How You Can Support Us  

As a **non-profit gGmbH**, we are always looking for collaborations and support — whether that’s financial backing, help with marketing, or sharing expertise. If you’d like to be part of our journey, our inbox at **team@elara-aerospace.com** is always open.  

*For more information about our incorporation or to discuss potential business opportunities, please contact our team.*
