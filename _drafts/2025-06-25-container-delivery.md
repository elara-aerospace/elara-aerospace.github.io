# Expanding Our Work Area with Three New Containers  
## A Long-Awaited Delivery  

In the second half of June, we finally received a delivery we had been eagerly awaiting: **three containers, generously provided by Mein Lagerraum3**. After arriving by truck, they were carefully unloaded and positioned on-site with the help of a crane.  

## Building Space for Progress  

These containers are more than just storage units — they mark the next step in expanding our capabilities. We’re already equipping them with work equipment and workstations, transforming them into versatile spaces that will serve as **workspace, storage, and even testing facilities**.  

## Creating Room for Innovation  

With this new infrastructure, we’re better prepared than ever to tackle the challenges ahead. Every square meter counts when you’re building rockets — and with the support of partners like **m3**, we’re steadily creating the environment our team needs to innovate and succeed.  

## Support Us with Equipment  

To make the most of these new containers, we’re always on the lookout for more equipment — from **workshop machinery to basic tools and electric drills**.  

If you or your company can provide support, we’d love to hear from you. Our inbox at **team@elara-aerospace.com** is always open.
