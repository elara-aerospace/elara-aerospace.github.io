# Elara Aerospace Moves into New Office at TUM Venture Labs  
## Finally a place in Garching  

At the end of April, we officially moved into our new office and shared working space at **TUM Venture Labs**, located in the Newton building (also known as the Oerlikon building) at *Freisinger Landstraße 62*. This marks an exciting new chapter for Elara Aerospace as we continue to expand our research and collaboration activities.  

## A Place for Collaboration and Growth  

The shared workspace provides us with a dynamic environment for productive working sessions. Beyond desk space, we now have access to a fully equipped meeting room – the perfect setting for hosting discussions with our partners and collaborators. It’s a space that allows ideas to grow and partnerships to thrive.  

## Thanks to Our Supporters  

We are grateful to the **TUM Venture Labs team** for welcoming us into this innovative ecosystem and providing us with the resources to succeed. A special thank you goes out to **Nick Loth**, whose support and facilitation made this office move possible.  

*For more information about our new headquarters or to schedule a visit, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team.*
