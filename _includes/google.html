Google Analytics 4
If you have given your consent, this website uses Google Analytics 4, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. The controller for users in the EU/EEA and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland ("Google").

Nature and purpose of the processing
Google Analytics 4 uses cookies that enable an analysis of your use of our websites. The information collected by means of the cookies about your use of this website is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

[OPTIONAL: We use the User ID function. User ID allows us to assign a unique, persistent ID to one or more sessions (and the activities within those sessions) and to analyse user behaviour across devices].

[OPTIONAL: We use Google Signals. This allows Google Analytics to collect additional information about users who have personalised ads enabled (interests and demographics) and ads can be delivered to these users in cross-device remarketing campaigns].

Google Analytics 4 has IP anonymisation enabled by default. Due to IP anonymisation, your IP address will be shortened by Google within Member States of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. According to Google, the IP address transferred by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.

Third country transfer
For the USA, the European Commission adopted a news adequacy decision on 10 July 2023. Google LLC is certified under the EU-US Privacy Framework.
