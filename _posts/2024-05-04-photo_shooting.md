Elara Aerospace recently held a special team photo and headshot event to celebrate the unity and diversity of our workforce. The photo shoot took place at Munich University of Applied Sciences and included team members from all our departments. This event showcased our collaborative and dynamic culture, full of camaraderie and laughter that reflect the positive environment we foster at Elara Aerospace.

Team photos and headshots are more than just pictures; they symbolise our unity and identity. For us, these images represent our commitment to transparency, approachability and the incredible individuals that make up our team. They serve as a reminder of the diverse expertise and collaborative spirit that drives us towards our goals.

The photo day was a resounding success thanks to the enthusiasm of our team and our great photographer Tobias. Each headshot captured the unique personality and passion of our team members, while the group shots highlighted our unity and collective drive.

We look forward to sharing these new photos on our website and social media channels. Stay tuned to meet the faces behind Elara Aerospace and get a glimpse of the people behind our journey to the stars.
