Elara Aerospace recently had the honour of speaking at [Autodesk University](https://conferences.autodesk.com/flow/autodesk/au2024/web/page/overview) in [San Diego (United States)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XkvNjFNE2ivwUsZx5), an experience that left a lasting impression on both our team and the eventâ€™s audience. Held from 15th to 17th October 2024, the event proved to be one of the highlights of the year, and weâ€™re beyond grateful to Autodesk for making it all possible. The opportunity [**to present Elara Aerospaceâ€™s bold mission**](https://pr-886-next.au-uw2-dev.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Soaring-Toward-the-Stars-with-the-Autodesk-Fusion-Platform-The-Elara-Aerospace-Journey-2024) to a diverse and engaged audience was both exciting and humbling. Our team shared how we are pushing the limits of space exploration and explained how Autodeskâ€™s powerful tools, particularly [Autodesk Fusion](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview), are enabling us to turn our groundbreaking ideas into tangible reality. The presentation was streamed live to a global audience, which allowed us to reach even more space enthusiasts and innovators from around the world.

This event was not only about showcasing our work but also about recognizing the incredible support weâ€™ve received from Autodesk. The collaboration with [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) has been vital in helping us advance our ambitious projects, and we owe much of our success to the talented individuals at Autodesk who have been with us every step of the way.

A special thank you goes out to the Autodesk team (pictured above). Their support, guidance, and collaborative spirit have been indispensable in helping us move closer to our goals. We are inspired by their dedication and thrilled to continue working together.

As we look ahead to the future, we are filled with excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead. The stars seem even closer now, and weâ€™re more determined than ever to make space exploration accessible and sustainable for generations to come.

We would like to thank everyone who attended the event and showed their support for our mission.
