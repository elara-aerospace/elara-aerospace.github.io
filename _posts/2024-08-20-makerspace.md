We are determined at Elara Aerospace to continuously push the boundaries in innovation within the aerospace environment, with a driven passion for advancement in the field of aerospace. So, we are pleased to share with you the progress of one of our recent small projects: our test stand, called S.P.A.R.K. It stands for Systematic Propulsion Analysis & Research Kernel and is designed with simplicity and modularity in mind to perform the most important initial test on our rocket engine components. S.P.A.R.K. represents the first leap in our journey toward reaching our goals and breaking records.

The realization of this important test stand could not have come to life without the invaluable support of Makerspace GmbH. Their cutting-edge equipment-from precision fabrication to state-of-the-art machines for realizing prototyps-has remained at the core of reproducing our detailed CAD designs of the S.P.A.R.K. test stand. More than just the technical resources, the collaborative and innovative atmosphere fostered at Makerspace GmbH has created a highly valued partnership that allows us to take ideas from the ambitious to the tangible.
