At Elara Aerospace, diversity drives our innovation. Our team, made up of individuals from different nationalities and cultural backgrounds, demonstrates the power of inclusivity to drive breakthrough advances.

United by our goal to launch the first student-built bi-liquid Methalox rocket to an altitude of 100 kilometres, we use our diverse perspectives to push the boundaries of aerospace exploration. Our team currently includes around 20 students from a range of universities and academic disciplines, each bringing a vital diversity of thought and experience. With members from three universities contributing unique expertise, we foster a rich environment of ideas and solutions.

This mix of backgrounds fosters innovation and enhances our ability to tackle challenges and develop breakthrough technologies. Our collaborative spirit is central to our mission and drives us to achieve what was once thought impossible. As we expand, we welcome students who share our passion for aerospace innovation, believing that a diverse team drives innovation and success. By welcoming new members from diverse backgrounds, we aim to further enrich our collaborative environment and advance our mission.
