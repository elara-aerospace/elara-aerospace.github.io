Elara Aerospace had the privilege of participating in this year's Big Tech Day, an event hosted by TNG Technology Consulting at Motorworld MÃ¼nchen. Our team was thrilled to present our speech titled "How to Build a Rocket in One Year" to an enthusiastic audience.

Joined by our team members Adrian Jean-Ludwig Leutner, Vincent Preuss, Tom Luca Reinhardt, and Tobias JÃ¤ger, we delved into the intricacies of developing the Elara Aerospace rocketâ€”from strategy to the successful launch in Sardinia within a year. It was an honor to showcase our achievements and insights to such an amazing crowd.

Big Tech Day proved to be an exceptional experience filled with inspiring speeches, insightful discussions, and the opportunity to connect with remarkable individuals like Christoph Stock. Meeting and exchanging ideas with peers and industry leaders further fueled our passion for innovation and aerospace technology.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to TNG Technology Consulting for organizing this outstanding event. Their meticulous planning and dedication created a platform where ideas flourish and collaborations thrive. Special gratitude goes to our sponsors whose unwavering support has turned our dreams into reality.

As we reflect on the success of Big Tech Day 2024, we are already looking forward to next yearâ€™s event. Stay tuned for more updates and insights from Elara Aerospace as we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in aerospace engineering.
