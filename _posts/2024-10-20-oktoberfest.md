A few weeks ago on the 2nd of October, the team at Elara Aerospace was finally able to get together in person to celebrate the annual Oktoberfest this year with all its boisterous and lively festivities in tow, taking a much-needed break and connecting outside of work. This was a great opportunity for the team to relax, enjoy the fair and continue to bond over what makes our working team so strong. It also allowed many of the team members who knew each other to catch up, and newer members - some of whom had travelled a long way - to join in the celebrations, some meeting their colleagues for the first time. 

Our team has grown considerably over the last few weeks as we have welcomed many amazing new recruits to the Elara Aerospace team. And seeing everyone in person has really underlined the positivity and enthusiasm that each person brings to the team. The Oktoberfest was a great backdrop for these introductions: everyone came together, celebrated, shared stories and made new memories. 

The spirit of community and shared experiences of the day reminded us how important these links are in, not only team spirit but in firming up our collaboration in attaining ambitious goals. It's an inspiration to see how our diverse team goes from longtime colleagues to recent additions all in one, united by a common compelling view for the future in aerospace.
