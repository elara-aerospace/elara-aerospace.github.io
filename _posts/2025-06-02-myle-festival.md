## Rockets Among Supercars  

From **May 30th to June 1st**, Elara Aerospace was proud to showcase our work at the **MYLE Festival** at Munich’s iconic **Motorworld**. The event is usually home to the fastest and most powerful cars in the world – but this time, we brought something even more powerful: a **20,000-horsepower rocket engine**.  

## Engaging the Public with Space Innovation  

At our booth, visitors had the chance to:  
- See a variety of technical components up close  
- Learn about our ongoing projects  
- Talk with the team behind them  

We also handed out information flyers and launched a new initiative: the **“Send Your Name to Space”** campaign. With this program, supporters can contribute and have their name engraved inside one of our rockets — a unique way to be part of our mission.  

## Inspiring the Next Generation  

The **MYLE Festival** gave us the opportunity to connect with the general public, many of whom share a fascination for high-performance engineering. We are proud to demonstrate that students and young professionals, even with limited resources, can design and build technology that pushes the boundaries of aerospace innovation.
