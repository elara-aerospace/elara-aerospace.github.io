Two weeks ago, on Thursday the 27th of June, Elara Aerospace joined the vibrant community at TUM Entrepreneurship Day, held at the Technical University of Munich to celebrate all things entrepreneurship, innovation and start-ups. This annual event, co-hosted by UnternehmerTUM and TUM Venture Labs, transformed the campus into a hub of innovation and collaboration.

We had an amazing time meeting talented students and exchanging ideas with fellow entrepreneurs. The energy and enthusiasm was palpable as we explored new opportunities and shared our vision for the future of aerospace.

Our experience at the TUM Entrepreneurship Day was truly inspiring. We're looking forward to building on the momentum of the event and working with like-minded people who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology.

Join us on this journey of innovation and discovery. Stay tuned for updates on our upcoming projects and events.
