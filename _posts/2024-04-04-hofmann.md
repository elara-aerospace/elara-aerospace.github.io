We are pleased to announce a significant milestone in our journey towards space exploration: Elara Aerospace has entered into a strategic partnership with the prestigious Technical University of Munich (TUM). On 1st April our team met with Prof. Thomas F. Hofmann, President of TUM, to formalise this collaboration. 

As a leader in space innovation, Elara Aerospace is very proud to be associated with TUM, a renowned institution that is renowned for its contributions to engineering and technology. With the invaluable support of UnternehmerTUM and TUM Venture Labs, we are ready to push the boundaries of space exploration. 

This partnership marks an important stage in our journey. Together with TUM, we are committed to shaping the future of space exploration through collaborative research, innovative endeavours and educational outreach. 

We would like to express our sincere appreciation to all those who have supported us so far. Special thanks go to UnternehmerTUM for their crucial support through our Prototyping Grant, as well as to TUM Venture Labs Aerospace and Additive Manufacturing. We look forward to continuing to work with TUM as we embark on this exciting venture together. 

Stay tuned for further updates as we embark on this remarkable journey.
