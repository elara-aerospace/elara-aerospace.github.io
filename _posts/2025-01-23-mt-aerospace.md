*Inside MT Aerospace's Factory*

This month marked a major milestone for Elara Aerospace as our team had the incredible opportunity to visit MT Aerospace, one of Europeâ€™s leading aerospace innovators. The experience was nothing short of inspiring and deeply aligned with our mission to build the worldâ€™s largest reusable Methalox rocket developed by students under 30.

MT Aerospaceâ€™s cutting-edge work in space technology, composite structures, and additive manufacturing reflects the same principles we hold at Elara Aerospace â€” innovation, sustainability, and bold ambition. Being able to connect with a company that plays a key role in launch vehicle development and satellite systems gave our team valuable insights into what it takes to push the boundaries of space exploration.

More than just a visit, this connection is a meaningful leap forward. For a student-led
organization like Elara Aerospace, having access to the knowledge, experience, and potential collaboration with a company of MT Aerospace's caliber is a huge boost. It reinforces that our vision is not only valid but vital-and supported by the very industry we aspire to join.

We are grateful for the opportunity and excited about the doors this relationship could open. The future is bright, and thanks to MT Aerospace, it feels even closer.
