## Inspiring Young Professionals  

On **28th March 2025**, our team members **Tom-Luca Reinhardt** and **Tobias Jäger** presented Elara Aerospace at the **BayernLB X VÆRIDION Young Professionals Network**. In their talk, they highlighted how quickly generative design and 3D printing can transform ideas into prototypes — even demonstrating it live by printing a part during the session.  

## Bridging Finance and Aerospace  

The event was a unique opportunity to connect with young professionals from the finance sector and beyond, opening new perspectives on how aerospace innovation and financial expertise can complement one another. We were proud to showcase what students can achieve with limited resources but big ambitions.  

## Open for Collaboration
