The 23rd of October was an exciting day for Elara Aerospace as we proudly represented our passion for space exploration at the TUM Student Club Fair. The event provided us with a vibrant platform to connect with students, faculty and fellow enthusiasts, all eager to discuss the future of aerospace innovation.

The atmosphere at the TUM Student Club Fair was electric, buzzing with curiosity, creativity and the same ambition: to push the boundaries. Our team was there with a our very first appearance at the Student Club Fair to showcase our project and aspirations, while serving as a point of contact for students interested in learning more about aerospace and our journey. 

We took the opportunity to share our vision, give an insight into our rocket design process and discuss the cutting-edge technologies that drive our innovation. Visitors were intrigued by our ambition to transform space and how they could be part of this transformative journey.
