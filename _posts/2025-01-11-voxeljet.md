*Inside Voxeljet's Advanced Additive Manufacturing: Elara Aerospace Discovers Next-Generation 3D Production Technologies*

Yesterday, our team had the incredible opportunity to [visit the Voxeljet factory in Friedberg, Germany](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9sZxdWPRoGixVM9H8), a leading innovator in industrial 3D printing and manufacturing. This tour provided us with invaluable insights into the future of manufacturing and additive technologies.

[Voxeljet's state-of-the-art facility](https://www.voxeljet.com/) showcased their advanced 3D printing systems, which are revolutionizing production environments across industries. Their binder-jet technology, seamlessly integrated into production lines, is redefining the economics and applications of additive manufacturing.

During our tour, we were particularly impressed by:

- [**Industrial 3D Printing**](https://www.voxeljet.com/industrial-3d-printer/): We witnessed firsthand how Voxeljet's systems are capable of producing complex components with unprecedented efficiency and scale.
- [**Sand Casting**](https://www.voxeljet.com/3d-printing-solution/sand-casting/): The tour demonstrated how 3D printing is transforming traditional [sand casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_casting) processes, allowing for more intricate designs and faster production times.
- [**Investment Casting**](https://www.voxeljet.com/3d-printing-solution/investment-casting/): We learned about the application of 3D printing in creating highly detailed [investment casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_casting) patterns, opening new possibilities for [PMMA components](https://w.wiki/CgwS).

The visit reinforced our belief in the potential of additive manufacturing for the aerospace industry. Voxeljet's highly efficient processes and unparalleled production scales offer unique advantages that could significantly improve our current Starlight production pipeline and future rocket projects.

As we continue to push the boundaries of aerospace engineering at Elara Aerospace, partnerships with innovative companies like Voxeljet will be crucial. We look forward to exploring how these cutting-edge 3D printing technologies can enhance our manufacturing capabilities and drive innovation in rocket design and production.
