## Coming Together as One Team  

At the beginning of April, we gathered for a full **Team Alignment Day** at the **StudiTUM** in the city center of Munich. All team members currently in Munich came together to sync up, exchange ideas, and make sure that we’re pulling in the same direction.  

## Defining Mission and Timelines  

The day was dedicated to discussing our shared mission and mapping out a time plan that works for everyone. Later, our sub-teams broke out into focused working sessions to define their own timelines and align them with the main project goals.  

## Strengthening Team Spirit  

Of course, no alignment day would be complete without good food and shared experiences — and so we enjoyed a classic schnitzel lunch at **Steinheil** before wrapping up the evening. Events like this are key to keeping productivity and efficiency high, ensuring every member is motivated and working together toward our ambitious goals.
