Elara Aerospace is embarking on a thrilling new chapter in our mission to revolutionize the space industry with a groundbreaking partnership. We have teamed up with OLM Launch to execute the Test & Suborbital Launch campaign for our first single-stage reusable suborbital rocket, Starlight. Over the next year, the campaign will take Starlight through rigorous testing, followed by a suborbital launch to an impressive altitude of 150 kilometers, culminating in a sea recovery of its first stage 50 kilometers downrange.

The launch activities will take place at a [DIFESA](https://www.difesa.it/eng/index.html)-managed [NATO](https://www.nato.int/) military site in [Sardinia (Italy)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PfmXuDyGXjRgCs869), with OLM serving as the commercial operator. OLM's CEO [Alberto de Iorio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alberto-d-459b17a6/) described the partnership as a "game-changer" for Europe's launch capabilities, emphasizing its potential to enhance commercial access to space. This collaboration is a critical step in the advancement of reaching our target and providing opportunities for other students to work on rockets and contribute to innovation.

As the team at Elara Aerospace prepares Starlight for its launch, we would like to express our gratitude for the opportunity to work with OLM and are very excited to share this historic journey with the world. The launch is not just a technical achievement—it’s a major leap forward in making space more accessible, sustainable, and innovative.
